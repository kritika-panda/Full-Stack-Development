Step 1: Install Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
ToolInstall Command / Link
npm
Comes bundled with
Expo CLInpm install -g expo-cli
:bulb: To verify installation, run node -v, npm -v, and expo -V in your terminal.
:test_tube: Step 2: Initialize Your Expo Project
bash
npx create-expo-app CaseEscalationApp
cd CaseEscalationApp
npm start
:mag: This launches Expo DevTools in your browser. You can scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your phone to preview your app.
:toolbox: Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following in your project directory:
bash
npm install axios redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit @react-native-picker/picker
These packages will help with:
axios: Making API calls
redux & @reduxjs/toolkit: State management
@react-native-picker/picker: Dropdown fields like Priority, Escalation Type, etc.
:card_index_dividers: Step 4: Create Folder Structure
Inside your project:
/CaseEscalationApp
│
├── /src
│   ├── /components        # FormInput, DropdownInput, etc.
│   ├── /redux             # store.js, caseSlice.js
│   ├── /api               # API layer (submitCase endpoint)
│   └── /screens           # CaseFormScreen.js
Now that your base is ready, I’ll walk you through the next steps:
Set up Redux store and slice
Build the first UI block with inputs and dropdowns

React -> JavaScript+SWC
11:59
Choose: JavaScript + SWC
Why?
SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) gives you drastically faster dev/build times than Babel
It works seamlessly behind the scenes—you still write plain .js or .jsx files
It's officially supported in Vite and is future-proof as more teams move away from Babel
When not to choose it:
Only skip + SWC if you're targeting very old browsers or integrating with legacy build tools—but for your form app (and a future PBC workflow), JavaScript + SWC is optimal.
Once you select that option, I’ll help you:
Structure the project
Set up your first form page
Add Tailwind or CSS modules if you'd like styling help too

for each section create microservices
Absolutely, Kritika—this is a smart move if you want to eventually scale the application and maintain separation of concerns. Let’s outline how to structure microservices that map directly to each major section of your escalation form.
:bricks: Microservices Architecture for Escalation Form
Each form section can be modeled as a standalone microservice with its own database schema, validation logic, and API endpoints.
:small_blue_diamond: 1. Submitter Service
Handles info about the person submitting the case.
FeatureValueEndpointPOST /api/submittersPayload{ submittedBy, submitterEmail, submissionDate, priority, escalationType }StoragePostgreSQL or MongoDB table: submittersService Namesubmitter-service
:small_blue_diamond: 2. Product & Plan Service
Manages details about the product and plan associated with the case.
FeatureValueEndpointPOST /api/product-planPayload{ caseNumber, productName, planType, coverageStartDate, coverageEndDate }Storageproduct_plan tableService Nameproduct-plan-service
:small_blue_diamond: 3. Member Info Service
Handles patient/member details—could be reused in future applications as a separate identity service.
FeatureValueEndpointPOST /api/member-infoPayload{ memberFirstName, memberLastName, dateOfBirth, memberId, groupNumber, memberEmail, zipCode, confirmationCode, rallyId }Storagemembers tableService Namemember-info-service
:globe_with_meridians: How to Connect Them
Use API Gateway or GraphQL Gateway to orchestrate requests.
Each service can publish events (e.g., via Kafka or RabbitMQ) to signal case creation/update.
Authentication can be handled by a shared identity/auth service.
Bonus: Composing Services
You could use an orchestrator service (like case-aggregator) that listens to each of the microservices and links the records under a master caseId.
Would you like me to scaffold the Express backend for these services using folders like submitter-service, product-plan-service, etc.? Or set up a Postman collection and Swagger spec to simulate them locally first?
We can make this production-grade, one piece at a time :muscle::jigsaw:

Import Spring Boot Project into Eclipse
:white_check_mark: 1. Unzip the Folder
Unzip the .zip you downloaded from [start.spring.io] — it should contain folders like src, pom.xml, and src/main/java.
:white_check_mark: 2. Open Eclipse & Choose a Workspace
Launch Eclipse IDE and select your desired workspace directory when prompted.
:white_check_mark: 3. Import the Project
If it’s a Maven project:
Click File > Import
Choose: Existing Maven Projects under Maven
Click Next
Navigate to the unzipped folder and select it
Eclipse should detect pom.xml. Click Finish
If it’s a Gradle project:
Click File > Import
Choose Gradle > Existing Gradle Project
Click Next, then locate the root folder
Click Finish
:white_check_mark: 4. Wait for Dependencies to Load
Eclipse will download dependencies automatically in the background. You might see a progress bar in the bottom right. Once done:
You should see your src/main/java and src/main/resources
application.properties will be under resources
Your main class (e.g., CaseformBackendApplication.java) should have a green "play" icon
:arrow_forward: 5. Run It
Right-click the main class → Run As > Spring Boot App
Tip: If Spring Boot App doesn't show up, try Run As > Java Application, then add Spring Boot DevTools later.

tep 1: Install Maven
Go to the official download page: :point_right:
Download the binary zip archive for Windows (e.g., apache-maven-3.9.x-bin.zip)
Extract it to a folder like: C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven
:hammer_and_wrench: Step 2: Add Maven to Your System PATH
Open Start Menu → Search → Edit system environment variables
Click Environment Variables
Under System Variables, find and select Path, then click Edit
Click New and add the path to Maven’s bin folder:
C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\bin
Click OK on all dialogs
Close and reopen your terminal or Eclipse Terminal
Run:
bash
mvn -v
If it prints Maven version info, you’re good to go! :white_check_mark:
Once Maven is installed and running, re-run:
bash
mvn clean install

1. Switch to Eclipse’s Embedded Maven (or External One)
Sometimes Eclipse’s internal Maven (m2e) conflicts with your system Maven. Let’s make sure it’s using the right one:
Go to Window > Preferences
Navigate to Maven > Installations
If you see only one (embedded), click Add...
Choose External
Browse to:
C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\apache-maven-3.9.10
Click Finish, then Apply and Close
Select the external Maven and set it as default
Then:
Right-click your project → Maven > Update Project... → tick Force Update → OK
